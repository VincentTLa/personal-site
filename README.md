# Welcome to my repository for my site!

This site was made using Remix! Learn more about it here:

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

The technology stack that this site will use will be:

- Remix
- Node.JS
- TailwindCSS
- MongoDB
- Jest

## Development

To run the site locally from your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
